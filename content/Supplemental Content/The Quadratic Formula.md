The quadratic formula is a formula used to solve quadratic equations. The quadratic formula can be seen below:
$$ \\ $$
$$
\begin{gather}
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a} \\ \\
\text{Where } a \text{, } b \text{, and } c \text{ are the coefficients of a quadratic equation such as the one below:} \\
ax^{2}+bx+c=0
\end{gather}
