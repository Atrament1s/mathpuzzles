$$ \\ $$
First, we need to convert $18\%$ to a decimal value:

$$
\begin{gather*}
&\quad&\quad 18\% \\ \\
&=&\quad \frac{18}{100} \\ \\
&=&\quad \enclose{circle}{ \ 0.18 \ }
\end{gather*}
$$

$$ \\ $$

Next, we can multiply $0.18$, which we got from the previous step, by $50$ to find how many pieces of candy he gave to each friend:

$$
\begin{gather*}
&\quad&\quad 50 \cdot 0.18 \\ \\
&=&\quad \enclose{circle}{ \ 9 \ }
\end{gather*}
$$

$$ \\ $$

Since Mike has three friends, we can find the amount of candy he gave away in total by multiplying $9$, which we got from the previous step, by $3$:

$$
\begin{gather*}
&\quad&\quad 9 \cdot 3 \\ \\
&=&\quad \enclose{circle}{ \ 27 \ }
\end{gather*}
$$

$$ \\ $$

Finally, to find how many pieces of candy Mike will have left, we can subtract $27$, which we got from the previous step, from his starting amount of candy, $50$ pieces.

$$
\begin{gather*}
&\quad&\quad 50-27 \\ \\
&=&\quad \enclose{circle}{ \ 23 \ }
\end{gather*}
$$

$$ \\ $$

Therefore, Mike will have $23$ pieces of candy left over after giving each of his $3$ friends $18\%$ of his $50$ pieces of candy.
